# C-Primer-Plus-Exercises

Some solutions to exercises from the book *C Primer Plus* by Stephen Prata.

The purpose of this repo is to record my learning from the book. Some solutions may not be correct or may not be the best solution.

I know there have already been many similar repos on GitHub. Therefore, if you would like to point out any mistakes or suggest better solutions, I would be grateful. 

Please feel free to open issues or make pull requests!

Hope we can learn from each other.
